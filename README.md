# Property-Management-System
Property Management System secured using blockchain technology

# What have we built?
1. Ethereum smart contracts with the Solidity programming language.
2. Tests for the smart contracts in JavaScript
3. Deployed the smart contracts to a blockchain
4. Created a client side website with Web3.js and React.js so that users can talk to the smart contracts.

Whenever someone purchases the item, they instantly become the owner. That’s because this application is powered by a smart contract on the blockchain which manages the market place. It tracks who owns the items for sale, and it transfers the ownership of the items automatically anytime someone purchases them with cryptocurrency. It works like a vending machine.

# What Is A Blockchain?
A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that all talk to one another. These nodes are essentially computers that share responsibilities similar to web servers, like running programs and storing data that can be accessed whenever you're connected to the blockchain. All the nodes work together to create a public network that anyone can connect to.

# What Is A Smart Contract?
Smart contracts the building blocks we use to create blockchain applications. They are programs that we can write with source code and deploy to the blockchain. They are written in the Solidity programming language.

Smart contracts are immutable, which means that once they've been created they cannot change! Once a smart contract is deployed to a blockchain, its code cannot be updated like a normal application. That's because it represents a digital contract or agreement. After all, you wouldn't want any other real-world contract to change after it is created, would you?

# Installing Dependencies

## Ganache Personal Blockchain
It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux as as a desktop application and a command line tool. You can find the latest release for your operating system [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
## Node.JS
If you don't have node already installed you can visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download it.
## Truffle Framework
Now let's install the Truffle Framework, which provides a suite of tools for developing Ethereum smart contacts with the Solidity programming language.

`npm install -g truffle`
## Metamask Ethereum Wallet
Most major web browsers do not currently connect to blockchain networks, so we'll have to install a browser extension that allows them to do this.
To install Metamask, visit this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) or search for the Metamask Chrome plugin in the Google Chrome web store. 

Once you’ve installed it, be sure that it is checked in your list of extensions.
